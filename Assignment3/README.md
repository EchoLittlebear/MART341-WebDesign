##### your questions

- The course itself is great. I've just been trying to adjust to my four online classes even though *online classes aren't my favorite*. I also have no idea how this semester is going to be I'm just hoping I am capable enough for it. 

- I'm pretty eager to learn **more coding** even if I only learn one new thing about it.

- I think I'll be okay handling things this semester but if I do need help I'll be sure to ask.
