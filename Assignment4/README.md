- Web browsers asks a server for information and the server sends back content such as Javascript and HTML then the web browser renders the content for its user. 

- DOM the Document Object Model is a document's interface and powers web pages by making its structure easy for programming languages to intervene.  

- HTMl displays content but XML defines it and XHTML is the better and more precise version of HTML. 

- A declaration, head element, root element, and a body element.

- The index.html is what the browser looks for when a URL doesn't specify a file. 

- To organize your coding you should have your DOCtype at the very top, the head just below that, then the body below the head, and html starting above the head and closing at the very end. Every piece of code should have a start and an end, like for example <p>example sample</p>.
