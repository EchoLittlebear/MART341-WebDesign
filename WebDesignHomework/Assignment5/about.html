<h1>More on those three website ideas</h1>

<h3>Blogs</h3>
<p>I want to create a blog that resembles those from the early 2000s disney channel shows because its a cute idea and younger me has dreamed of creating one.</p>
<br/>

<h3>Interactive Site</h3>
<p>I really like interactive websites so trying to create one sounds complicated but it'll be worth it.</p>
</br.>

<h3>Food related website</h3>
<p>I get hungry sometimes so I browse resturant and bakery websites near me to order something or get inspired to make something. Because of this I thought what if I made my a website for a food service and what would it look like?</p>
