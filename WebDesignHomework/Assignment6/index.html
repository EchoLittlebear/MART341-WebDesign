    <ul> 
        <li>I came in for a lunch break and had the best mashed potaotes I've ever tasted and the steak was just right. Also great people. </li> 
        <br>
        <li>My son ordered a soup here once and said, "it tasted homemade", which made him visit here as much as he could before he left the state.</li> 
        <br>
        <li>The servers were very kind and theres lots of food options. Its a very welcoming environment with great service. I'll eat here till I die. </li>
        <br>
        <li><s>Poor presentation but as for the food it can be a hit or miss.</s> Had a very fulfilling sandwich with creamy cheese in it and a poor pasta salad that wasn't thoroughly cooked. The second salad I got from them wasn't any better, but so far thats been my only complaint.</li>
    </ul>
