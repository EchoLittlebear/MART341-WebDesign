In your README.md, note how you applied the balance concepts we’ve discussed this week. How did adjusting width or background color help improve your layout?

-  I've applied the width element in hopes that the screen will adjust to the user's device when they open the page. I've also added the element to change the background color so that there's experimentation with creative design. Lastly, I've changed the headings to a different color so that they sort of match the whole color palette. This gave my site a more likeable touch because it wasn't so plain. ALso, I liked the inline CSS the most because I didn't have to edit every bit of code. 

How did your final design compare to your initial idea? Did the balance and layout turn out as expected, or did you have to make adjustments along the way?

- I initially considered a plain or overly detailed design for the website, but I chose a simple layout with some color. I resized the images to keep them from being too large and other than that everything else came together nicely. 

If you experimented with float and margin, please tell me about your experience.
Additionally, reflect on any challenges you faced during this assignment and how you overcame them. Did you encounter any issues with balancing content or using CSS? How did you solve them?

-I didn’t experiment with float and margin, unfortunately. 
As for the challenges I faced, I was concerned about how to write proper code. I believe I did okay, although there is room for improvement. I also felt that I should have added more information to make the site less boring, but I didn't have specific details for the fictional restaurant I created on the spot. I did find inspiration from real food websites, which was challenging because they often included links to various pages and with actual contact information, and so I just simplified what I could and focused on the essential information. No problems with coding so far. 

Finally, how are you doing? Is there anything specific I can do to support you in this class or beyond—whether it’s technical help or connecting you with additional resources?

- I'm doing way better in this class than I feared at the beginning and actually am enjoying it. Looking forward to a great semester.
