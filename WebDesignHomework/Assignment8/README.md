Divs: 
For the div elements I used them to seperate my title from my paragraphs and to experiment with stacking in my website. 

Span:
I used the span elements to highlight certain part in my paragraphs to adjust user's focus. 

Video: 
I'm not sure if the Iframe coding that I included counts toward a video but thats what the users would see I suppose. I think it adds something new to see. 

Iframe: 
For Iframe I took an embed video from YouTube to be in place of a video that would either introduce Divine Delights or give audiences a look into what they make.

Class: 
I used class to make it easier to edit multiple parts of my coding from the style element. Also for the same reason I used the span element. 

Escape character: 
As for the escape characters I used one of them to experiment in my paragraph as quotation marks and they're fairly simple and definitely my favorite type of coding so far. Although I will have to learn the language.
