I've learned how to adapt, communicate through code, organize my coding so its clear, problem solve, pay attention to the tiny details, and pick up where I left off. 
As for growth I've learned more css, how to create borders using divs, found more resources from outside coding like bootstrap, and learned more about coding as a creative career. 
My websites improved slowly, had their just ok times, and I kept experimenting to find newer things to add. 
My technical skills are beyond great, I just have to spend more time on them and make more notes. 
As for my workflow, I did best when I created a vision for what I wanted before actually going in to code. 
While I was being creative I tried to fix the smaller things such as borders, colors, fonts, images sizes, accessibilty, and where the eyes would follow.
