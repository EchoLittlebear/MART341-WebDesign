 As you work through the assignment, document how and why you applied each technique


### Overview 

- I used borders to create space and seperate everything

- I added color to give a theme

- I used css styling to make it easier to code and less crowded on the main coding page

- I gave space between everything to make it easier to scroll through

- I added navigation to connect the pages together so users would be able to move through the website easily

- I added information in the head coding in case it would be useful like it would in a real collaboration
