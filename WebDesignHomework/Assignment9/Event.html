How will you incorporate movement and rhythm into your instructable page?
I know I want to organize things so they're easy to read from left to right in a Z pattern, so the eyes will follow. Everything will be listed and in grids as usual, but maybe with some new adjustments like perspective.  As for rhythm, I'll be consistent with my colors, text, fonts, and spacing.-->
