<h3>At your local Divine Delights restaurant you can find their new event being hosted where customers are encouraged to find one of three symbols on one of their purchased cups. Theres limited time and only a certain amount of marked cups to be found so the time is ticking. There will be up to 10 winners who can chose to bring a few friends or family along with them depending on their situation. This event was hosted in apprecation for all of the support they're recieved within the past 6 months that made this sort of celebration available.</h3>
