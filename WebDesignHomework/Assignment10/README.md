# My New Main Page 


#### What I thought about the new discussion technique
- I thought it was more interactive and sort of inspiring to see other's websites. Compared to just hearing what they were saying before, this is nicer. 

#### Reasons for techniques that I used
- I applied DIVs to try and seperate my site to make it look more dynamic. 
- I applied colors to make everything inviting and less dull.
- I applied a navigation so its a little more like a website and less like an article. 
- I centered everything so everything could be read from top to bottom because its better than sitting on the side.
- I added a footer to make more space at the bottom but then I regretted it. 
- I added titles, descriptions, and an author name to make it detailed behind the scenes to practice working with collaborators who would need that information.
