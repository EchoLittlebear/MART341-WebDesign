Share the aspect of your website youâ€™re most proud of and why. Focus on specific design choices, functionality, or features that stand out.

- I'm most proud of how organized the coding is and of how much information I put together for this fictional food spot because the more information there is the more there is to see. I also really like the chioce of colors I made and how easy it is to figure out hypertext links. 

How are things going for you right now, and is there anything specific I can do to support you or improve your experience?

- Things are going great and coding is going smoothly but it does take forever. I mean theres nothing that can be done about it but its a shame haha.
